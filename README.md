# APC-Project

📝 Project Description:

This project implements a calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on very large numbers — numbers that are too big for built-in data types like int or long.

Instead of using standard data types, the numbers are handled as strings, and the arithmetic operations are manually implemented digit by digit.

🔍 Key Features:

Input numbers as strings
Support for:

➕ Addition

➖ Subtraction

✖️ Multiplication

Handles numbers with hundreds or thousands of digits

No use of built-in big integer libraries (done from scratch)
